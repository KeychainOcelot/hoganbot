To all my little Hulkamaniacs, say your prayers, take your vitamins and you will never go wrong
I'd rather be a good guy 24 hours a day than a bad guy just for a few minutes in the ring
Whatcha gonna do, when Hulkamania runs wild on you
I have no idea how many concussions I've ever had
It's tough because a lot of my friends are gay
Just to say something spiteful and hurtful, I don't get it
I'm real good with math, with numbers
I just like to treat people how they treat me
You make a lot of mistakes, tripping over your own feet and looking like a fool
Negativity and Hulkamania - 2 things that don't go together
I played bass guitar. I was big pals with Lars Ulrich and he asked me if I wanted to play bass with Metallica in their early days but it didn't work out
I've hung & I've bung
If I take the bandana off my head I'm completely bald
I know i'm going to hear all kinds of scar tissue popping
I hate to toot my own horn 
I just feel that I know people
I don't feel there is that Angelina Jolie/Brad Pitt barrier with me
I'm 58 years old and I just went through 8 back surgeries
It kind of ruins the mystique
Train. Say your prayers. Eat your vitamins
We run a very tight ship
I'm the man that made wrestling famous
I thought I had enough confidence to do it
I fear no man, no beast or evil, brother
Nobody told me how to talk or think
'Oh my God you're bigger than the hulk on TV'
I don't even like sitting in a sauna
If I have an extra large shirt on people go 'oh yeah you look small'
I tried it out in Japan and the people loved it
If I have a problem with someone I talk about them
Don't put a priority of being a friend with your wife first
The coolest thing is a huge Hulk Hogan, normal-sized pinball machine
People always expect Hulk Hogan to be standing up straight
Goodnight HULKAMANIACS and jabronie marks without a life that don't know it a work when you work a work and work yourself into a shoot
Damn Bam I wish you were still with us, I sure would love to hang out again my brother love u miss u
